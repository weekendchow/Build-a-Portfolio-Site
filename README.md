# Build-a-Portfolio-Site
---
This responsive Portfolio-Site is simply created using HTML and CSS for Udacity front-end nanodegree project. It will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects.

## What I learn
1. How HTML is used to define the content of a web page(HTML5 semantic tags).
2. start to think of every web page as a number of boxes on the screen(bootstrap Grid-Based Layout). 
3. How to position those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.
4. How to conforming to a style guide which is an important constraint.
